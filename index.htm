            Hello and welcome to monkeysinc.net, home of the they/them army.
          </p>
          <p>
            My name is Max Hougas. I'm a graduate of Valparaiso University's Engineering program with a BS in Computer Engineering and Computer Science.
            The job hunt after college didn't go so well, so I'm looking for projects to gain coding and computer skills.
            I spent some time working for minimum wage and a few years in The Army, but now I'm doing IS Support with TDS, and learning web developement with TBD.

            This server runs a couple of games for my discord buddies too. More information under the link on the left.
