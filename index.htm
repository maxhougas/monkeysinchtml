          Hello and welcome to monkeysinc.net, home of the they/them army.
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Max Hougas. I'm a graduate of Valparaiso University's Engineering program with a BS in Computer Engineering and Computer Science.
          The job hunt after college didn't go so well, so I'm looking for projects to gain coding and computer skills.
          I spent some time working for minimum wage and a few years in The Army. After getting out I enrolled in the ThriveDX cybersecurity certificate course, and spent some time doing web developement with TBD, but now my day job is IS Support with TDS.
