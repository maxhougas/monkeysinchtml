	  <h2>ArmA</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to the they/them army! We created this server as an alternative to a previous one that required hand made missions and a GM. <a href="./mods.htm">Mod list</a>.
          </p>
	  <h2>Craftopia</h2>
          <p>
            This server is down due to lack of interest and high resource consumption.
          </p>
          <h2>Factorio</h2>
          <p>
            This server is currently running no mods, and the game hasn't progressed very far.
          </p>
          <h2>Minecraft</h2>
          <p>
            This server used to run vanilla Minecraft. Experimentation with mods yielded unsatisfactory results, and this has been superceded by a dedicated Minecraft hosting service. You can talk to the Minecraft enthusiasts in the discord for more information.
          </p>
          <h2>Morrowind</h2>
          <p>
            This server runs Open Morrowind v8.0. It is very untested!
          </p>
          <h2>Teamspeak</h2>
          <p>
            This server is for integration with the Task Force Arrowhead Radio mod in the ArmA server.
          </p>
          <h2>Terraria</h2>
          <p>
            This server is unmodded; we're close to the beginning of hard mode.
          </p>
          <h2>Valheim</h2>
          <p>
            This server is down due to lack of interest and high resource consumption.
